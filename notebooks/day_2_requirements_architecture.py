    # Day 2 — Requirements Gathering, Scoping & Architecture Blueprints

    > **WAF Pillars covered:** Operational Excellence · Reliability · Security  
    > **Estimated time:** 2.5 hours  
    > **Sources:** `docs/curriculum/trainee/DAY_00_TRAINEE.md` §3-6,  
    > `docs/curriculum/trainer/DAY_00_TRAINER.md`, new FDE discovery content  
    > **Prerequisite:** Day 1 conceptual foundation.

    ---

    ## Learning Objectives

    By the end of this notebook you will be able to:

    1. Run a structured FDE discovery session to turn a vague brief into a scoped MVP.
    2. Write non-functional requirements (NFRs) specific to agentic AI workloads.
    3. Produce an Architecture Decision Record (ADR) that a team can act on.
    4. Read and explain the full AegisAP architecture blueprint.
    5. Describe the AegisAP data-flow narrative end-to-end.
    6. Identify and defend scoping boundaries — what is Day 1 MVP, what is Day 10 production.

    ---

    ## Where Day 2 Sits in the Full Arc

    Decisions made today govern every subsequent day. A weak scoping decision
    here creates technical debt that is very expensive to fix at Day 8.

    A **Forward Deployed Engineer** is not handed a spec sheet. You arrive with
    a vague directive: *"We need to do something with AI for invoices."*

    Your job is to convert that into a buildable, achievable, scoped system
    in under two hours of structured conversation. Here is the framework:

    ### Discovery in Five Phases

    | Phase | Question to answer | Output |
    |---|---|---|
    | **1. Problem framing** | What pain are we solving, for whom, measured how? | Problem statement + success metric |
    | **2. Data inventory** | What inputs exist, in what formats, at what volume? | Data asset list with quality notes |
    | **3. System boundaries** | What is in scope for this agent? What calls what? | Context diagram |
    | **4. Trust and compliance** | What data is sensitive? What decisions must be auditable? | Trust boundary + compliance flags |
    | **5. NFR elicitation** | Latency, cost, availability, accuracy targets — from the business | NFR table with numerical targets |

    ### Applying Discovery to AegisAP

    The original brief was: *"Our AP team spends too much time on manual invoice processing.
    Can we use AI?"*

    After a 90-minute discovery session:

    | Phase | AegisAP result |
    |---|---|
    | Problem framing | Reduce AP processing time from 45 min to < 2 min per invoice; error rate from 12% to < 1%; decision audit trail required |
    | Data inventory | Invoice PDFs (OCR available), ERP PO registry (REST API), vendor contracts (SharePoint PDFs), AP policy rulebook (Word doc) |
    | System boundaries | Agent handles extraction + routing + low-value auto-approval; humans handle approvals > £10k |
    | Trust and compliance | Invoice PDFs may contain PII (contact names, bank fragments); approval decisions are legally binding and must be auditable |
    | NFRs | Extraction p99 < 15 s, auto-approve accuracy ≥ 99.5%, mandatory escalation recall = 100%, cost per invoice < £0.10 |

    NFRs for AI systems are different from traditional software because:

    - **Accuracy is probabilistic** — you cannot guarantee 100%; you set thresholds and measure
    - **Cost has two components** — infrastructure (ACA, PostgreSQL) *and* model tokens
    - **Latency includes warm-up** — cold-starting a model deployment adds unpredictable latency
    - **Safety NFRs are hard constraints** — mandatory escalation recall must be 1.0, not "best effort"

    ### AegisAP NFR Table

    | NFR | Metric | Target | Monitoring | Consequence of breach |
    |---|---|---|---|---|
    | Extraction latency | p99 end-to-end | < 15 s | App Insights trace | SLA breach; user complaint |
    | Auto-approve accuracy | Precision on approved cases | ≥ 99.5% | Weekly eval run | Financial exposure |
    | **Mandatory escalation recall** | Recall on must-escalate cases | **= 1.0** | CI gate | **Release blocked** |
    | Cost per invoice | Token cost + infra amortised | < £0.10 | Cost ledger daily alert | Budget overrun |
    | Availability | System uptime | 99.5% | ACA health probe | SLA breach |
    | Durable state recovery | RTO after process crash | < 2 min | Resume smoke test | Approvals lost |
    | Audit completeness | Audit rows per decision | 100% | Append-only table row count | Compliance failure |
    | **Private networking posture** | No public endpoint reachable from internet | All AI services: `publicNetworkAccess=Disabled` + Private Endpoint | Gate `gate_private_network_static` in CI | **Release blocked** (Days 12, 14) |
    | **Data residency** | ARM `.location` of all AI resources | Single approved region (e.g., `uksouth`) | Gate `gate_data_residency` reading ARM API | **Release blocked** (Day 14) |

    > **Zero-tolerance NFRs** are those where *any* breach is a production incident,
    > regardless of frequency. Mandatory escalation recall is zero-tolerance because
    > a missed escalation means an unauthorised payment could be processed.
    > Private networking posture and data residency are equally zero-tolerance in
    > regulated-sector deployments — a misconfigured public endpoint is an immediate audit finding.

    > **ADR requirement (added Day 12):** Every ADR produced in this workshop must include
    > a **"Network Posture Decision"** field with one of: `public_endpoint`, `vnet_injected`,

**Date:** 2024-01-15 | **Status:** Accepted

**Context:** AegisAP requires a multi-step approval workflow with branching logic
(auto-approve vs. human review), durable state, and the ability to pause and resume.
We needed an orchestration layer that could represent conditional transitions as
inspectable code, not as a black-box agent loop.

**Decision:** Use LangGraph as the workflow orchestration layer.

**Rationale:** LangGraph represents workflows as a directed graph with typed state —
every node is a testable Python function, every edge is an explicit transition.
This makes the workflow auditable, debuggable, and independently testable.

**Alternatives considered:**
- **Vanilla ReAct agent loop** — rejected because it is non-deterministic and
  hard to audit. Each run may take a different path.
- **Temporal.io** — rejected because it requires a separate Temporal server,
  adds operational complexity, and LangGraph is sufficient for our scale.
- **Azure Durable Functions** — rejected because it binds us to C#/.NET heritage
  patterns and is harder to integrate with the Python ML/AI ecosystem.

**Consequences:**
- (+) Workflow is fully inspectable as a state graph
- (+) Each node is independently unit-testable
- (-) LangGraph adds a dependency; team must learn its API
- (-) Persistence requires custom checkpointing (PostgreSQL) beyond LangGraph's in-memory default

        "ADR-002: PostgreSQL for durable state (not Cosmos DB)": """
**Date:** 2024-01-20 | **Status:** Accepted

**Context:** From Day 5, AegisAP needs a durable store for workflow checkpoints,
approval tasks, and the idempotency ledger. The store must be ACID-compliant
and support structured queries (e.g., "all pending approval tasks for thread X").

**Decision:** Use Azure Database for PostgreSQL — Flexible Server.

**Rationale:** PostgreSQL provides ACID guarantees needed for the idempotency
ledger (duplicate prevention). It supports structured queries across the four
related tables. Azure Flexible Server supports Entra authentication natively
(Day 7 requirement).

**Alternatives considered:**
- **Azure Cosmos DB** — rejected for workflow state because eventual consistency
  is incompatible with the idempotency ledger's requirements. Cosmos DB is
  appropriate for unstructured agent memory (Day 6 discussion).
- **Azure Table Storage** — rejected because it lacks transactions across rows.
- **SQLite (in-process)** — rejected because it does not survive process
  restarts across Container App replicas.

**Consequences:**
- (+) Full ACID compliance; no duplicate side effects
- (+) Entra auth support eliminates password management
- (-) Additional Azure service to provision and manage
- (-) Requires schema migrations on updates (tracked in `scripts/apply_migrations.py`)

        "ADR-003: DefaultAzureCredential over API keys": """
**Date:** 2024-01-10 | **Status:** Accepted

**Context:** All Azure SDK calls require authentication. The choice is between
API keys/connection strings (simple but risky) and managed identity
(`DefaultAzureCredential`).

**Decision:** All Azure SDK calls use `DefaultAzureCredential`. API keys are
forbidden in application code and environment variables in staging/production.

**Rationale:** API keys do not expire, are stored as secrets, and have been the
source of multiple high-profile credential leaks. Managed Identity issues
short-lived tokens automatically — there is nothing to rotate, nothing to leak.
The `DefaultAzureCredential` chain degrades gracefully: `az login` in dev,
Managed Identity in production — no code change at promotion.

**Alternatives considered:**
- **API keys in Azure Key Vault** — rejected for services that support RBAC
  because Key Vault access itself requires a credential; managed identity removes
  the bootstrap problem entirely.
- **Service Principal + secret** — rejected because the secret must be stored
  somewhere (GitHub Actions, Key Vault) and has a rotation burden.

**Consequences:**
- (+) Zero stored secrets for Azure-native services
- (+) Credential source changes automatically between dev and prod
- (-) `az login` required in local dev — slight friction for new engineers
- (-) Services that do not support Managed Identity still need Key Vault

        "ADR-004: Structured outputs (JSON schema) for extraction": """
**Date:** 2024-01-18 | **Status:** Accepted

**Context:** Day 4 extraction requires the LLM to produce a JSON object matching
`InvoiceCandidate`. Without format constraints, the model may produce freeform JSON,
wrong field names, or refuse to populate optional fields.

**Decision:** Use Azure OpenAI `response_format` with `json_schema` and `strict: true`
for all extraction calls.

**Rationale:** Structured outputs guarantee the model's response matches the
declared JSON Schema. This eliminates field-name hallucination, wrong type
coercion, and missing required fields at the JSON level — leaving only logical
validation to Python. `strict: true` is essential; without it the guarantee is weaker.

**Alternatives considered:**
- **Prompt-only JSON instruction** — rejected because compliance is inconsistent
  and parsing failures are silent in production.
- **Tool calling / function calling** — acceptable but JSON schema is more direct
  for extraction use cases; function calling adds unnecessary wrapping overhead.

**Consequences:**
- (+) Eliminated JSON parse failures in extraction
- (-) `strict: true` does not allow `additionalProperties`; schema must be
  complete upfront — a schema change requires a prompt + schema change together
- (-) Not all model versions support `strict: true`; must pin deployment version

# ADR-001: LangGraph for workflow orchestration

**Date:** 2024-01-15 | **Status:** Accepted

## Context
AegisAP requires a multi-step approval workflow with branching logic
(auto-approve vs. human review), durable state, and the ability to pause and resume
while awaiting human approval. We needed an orchestration layer that could represent
conditional transitions as inspectable code, not as a black-box agent loop.

## Decision
Use LangGraph as the workflow orchestration layer.

## Rationale
- LangGraph represents workflows as a directed graph with typed state — every node is
  a testable Python function, every edge is an explicit transition.
- The workflow is auditable, debuggable, and independently testable at the node level.
- `StateGraph` handles the pause/resume requirement natively with custom checkpointers.

## Alternatives considered
- **Vanilla ReAct agent loop** — rejected because it is non-deterministic and hard
  to audit; each run may take a different path.
- **Temporal.io** — rejected because it requires a separate Temporal server and adds
  operational complexity beyond what this use case needs.
- **Azure Durable Functions** — rejected because it binds to C#/.NET heritage patterns
  and is harder to integrate with the Python ML/AI ecosystem.

## Consequences
- (+) Workflow is fully inspectable as a state graph
- (+) Each node is independently unit-testable
- (-) LangGraph adds a dependency; team must learn its API
- (-) Persistence requires custom checkpointing (PostgreSQL) beyond the in-memory default

    One of the most valuable skills an FDE has is knowing what to defer.
    Shipping a scoped, working Day 1 MVP creates more real-world value than
    an overengineered system that takes three months to deploy.

    ### AegisAP Scoping Matrix

    | Capability | MVP (Day 4) | Full production (Day 10) | Deferred rationale |
    |---|---|---|---|
    | Invoice extraction | ✅ In scope | ✅ In scope | — |
    | Routing rules | ✅ Hardcoded thresholds | ✅ App Configuration | Hardcoded is fine until rules change |
    | Human approval | ❌ Sync placeholder | ✅ Durable HITL + resume | Requires PostgreSQL + API |
    | Evidence retrieval | ❌ Mocked | ✅ Azure AI Search | Requires index provisioning |
    | PII redaction | ❌ Not implemented | ✅ Boundary-level redaction | No external sinks in MVP |
    | OTEL traces | ❌ print() logging | ✅ Azure Monitor + App Insights | OTEL adds boilerplate before infra exists |
    | Cost governance | ❌ None | ✅ Cost ledger + gates | No PAYG baseline data in MVP |
    | Multi-model routing | ❌ One model | ✅ Task-class routing | Cannot optimise without baseline data |
    | IaC deployment | ❌ Manual ACA | ✅ Bicep + GitHub Actions | Manual is fine for dev iteration |

    ### The Scoping Principle

    > **Build the trust boundary first.** Everything else can be deferred.
    > 
    > If Day 1 does not have a clean `InvoiceCandidate → CanonicalInvoice` boundary,
    > every subsequent day inherits technical debt. The structure of the validated contract
    > dictates the schema of the database, the fields in the audit log, and the shape of
    > the evaluation dataset.

# ADR-001: Azure AI Agent Service for ticket triage orchestration

**Date:** 2026-03-31 | **Status:** Accepted | **Deciders:** Engineering lead, FDE

## Context
The ticket triage agent needs an orchestration layer to manage tool calls (ticket lookup,
knowledge base search, team routing API) and maintain conversation history per ticket.
We need native Azure integration and minimal operational overhead.

## Decision
Use Azure AI Agent Service (AIAS) as the orchestration layer.

## Rationale
- AIAS is fully managed — no separate orchestration server to provision or scale
- Native integration with Azure AI Search (knowledge base retrieval) without custom wrappers
- Managed thread/memory storage eliminates our need to implement conversation history ourselves

## Alternatives considered
- **LangChain agents** — rejected because they require self-managed state, no native Azure RBAC
  integration, and add a framework dependency with a faster-moving API surface
- **LangGraph** — rejected for this use case because the triage workflow is linear, not
  graph-shaped; AIAS is simpler and sufficient

## Consequences
- (+) No orchestration infrastructure to manage
- (+) Native Managed Identity auth throughout
- (-) Less flexible than LangGraph for future non-linear workflows; may require migration if
  requirements become more complex
- (-) AIAS API is subject to Azure service versioning; migration effort if API changes

**Task:** Review the AegisAP scoping matrix in Section 6. Choose three items

1. Why it is deferred (not just "to save time")
2. What specific capability or data is missing in the MVP phase that makes it premature
3. What triggers the decision to build it (the condition that moves it from deferred to in-scope)

**1. OTEL traces deferred from MVP:**
Proper OTEL tracing requires an Application Insights connection string, which means
the Azure Monitor resource must be provisioned and the OTEL distro configured. In the
MVP phase (Days 1–4), the focus is on getting the extraction → validation → routing
pipeline correct — traces would add setup overhead without yet having a system worth
monitoring in production. The trigger to add OTEL: the first time a case fails in
staging and `print()` output is insufficient to diagnose why.

**2. Multi-model routing deferred from MVP:**
Task-class routing optimises cost by routing low-complexity calls to cheaper models.
But to know which task classes are low-complexity, you need baseline data: comparison
of model outputs on real cases. Without a traffic baseline, routing decisions are
guesses. The trigger to implement routing: 3 months of PAYG usage data showing which
task classes consistently produce equivalent results on a cheaper model.

**3. IaC deployment deferred from MVP:**
Manual Azure Container Apps deployments are adequate for a development iteration cycle.
IaC (Bicep + GitHub Actions) prevents configuration drift and enables team-wide
reproducible environments — but writing and testing Bicep adds 1–2 days of scope.
In the MVP phase, a single developer knows what is deployed because they deployed it.
The trigger: a second developer joins, or the system needs to be deployed to a second
environment (staging), at which point manual deployment creates divergence.
